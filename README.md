# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this ridesharing data analysis is to examine the relationship between ride fares, drivers, city types, and dates. By using Python along with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, we can visualize the relationship of all important ridesharing data to compare each city type's performance within a specific timeframe.

## Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 

The most popular type of city for ridesharing is Urban. Urban has a total of 1,625 rides with 2,405 drivers, and a total fare of $39,854.38. Although it has the most rides and drivers, Urban has the least amount of average fare per ride at $24.53 and average fare per driver at $16.57.

The second most popular type of city for ridesharing is Suburban. Suburban has a total of 625 rides with 490 drivers, and a total fare of $19,356.33.  Suburban has the second-highest amount of average fare per ride at $30.97 and average fare per driver at $39.50.

The least popular type of city is Rural. Rural has a total of 125 rides with 78 drivers, and a total fare of $4,327.93. Rural has the highest amount of average fare per ride at $34.62 and average fare per driver at $39.50.

## Summary
Even though Urban cities have the least amount of average fare per ride and driver, the number of rideshares is significantly higher than in Suburban and Rural. The line graph shows that the Urban city type earns the most fares per week from January - April 2019.

recommendations for CEO:
- Pyber should continue to prioritize the Urban city type as the main target audience. To push the total amount of fares higher. Pyber should advertise more towards hiring more drivers in urban cities by offering competitive pay. 
- Rural cities should be Pyber's second priority since the total fares are significantly lower. Pyber should offer more promotions and discounts targeted towards people in rural cities. 
- Suburban cities should have a similar approach to Rural, by offering promotions to increase ride shares but not as much as rural cities.
